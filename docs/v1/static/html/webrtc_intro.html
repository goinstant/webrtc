  <p>The Video and Audio widget provides a drop-in, back-end free video conferencing
  solution for your app. It's powered by <a href="./gortc.html">GoRTC library</a>, our integration
     with WebRTC. Using the Video and Audio widget means you don't need to setup a
     backend/server or configure WebRTC, just add our code into your app and you're
     set.</p>

  <p>If you want additional functionality beyond what's provided in the Video and
  Audio widget, you should look at the <a href="./gortc.html">GoRTC library</a>.</p>
