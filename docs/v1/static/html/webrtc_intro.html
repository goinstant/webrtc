  <p>The Audio and Video widget provides a drop-in, back-end free video
     conferencing solution for your app. It's powered by <a href="./gortc.html">
     GoRTC library</a>, our integration with WebRTC. Using the Video and Audio
     widget means you don't need to setup a backend/server or configure WebRTC,
     just add our code into your app and you're set.</p>
